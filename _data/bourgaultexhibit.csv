bourgault005,bourgaultnewspaper.pdf,Newspaper Article of Jean Julien Bourgault Exhibit,article/pdg,This newspaper article described the closing of the J.J. Bourgault exhibit at Bates College in 1977. This exhibit was important to the community because they got to meet the artist and see the incredible work he created. There were a couple different newspaper articles describing him and his artwork around this period. The arts were an important part of the Franco-American community so it makes sense that having a French-Canadian artist come into town was a big deal for the community. With the help of the Franco-American Centre and Bates College the exhibit was able to occur. ,Franco-American Centre,1977,no,single-page; article,"J.J.
