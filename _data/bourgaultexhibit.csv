bourgault005,bourgaultnewspaper.pdf,Newspaper Article of Jean Julien Bourgault Exhibit,article/pdg,This newspaper article described the closing of the J.J. Bourgault exhibit at Bates College in 1977.

There were a couple different newspaper articles describing him and his artwork around this period. The arts were an important part of the Franco-American community so it makes sense that having a French-Canadian artist come into town was a big deal for the community. With the help of the Franco-American Centre and Bates College the exhibit was able to occur. ,Franco-American Centre,1977,no,single-page; article,"J.J.
